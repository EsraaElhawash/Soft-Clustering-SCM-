# Soft-Clustering-SCM-
Implementing Soft clustering using python
Soft Clustering: In soft clustering, instead of putting each data point into a separate cluster, a probability or likelihood of that data point to be in those clusters is assigned.It gives each point a probability of membership in each cluster and their sum must equal 1.It differs from fuzzy clustering that the point mustn't belong to all clusters it may belong to one or more.

It can be used to segment images as a preprocessing technique.
